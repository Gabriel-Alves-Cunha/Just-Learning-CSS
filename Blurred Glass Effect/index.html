                <p>All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken and the dripping chassis of a junked console. A
                    narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors. No light but the muted
                    purring of the previous century. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from the
                    missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. After the postoperative check at the rear of the
                    arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game
                    console.
